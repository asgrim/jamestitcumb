I got back yesterday (absolutely exhausted) from [PHPNW14 conference](conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw14/), and I must say I had an absolutely fantastic time. Being a pretty new face in the community, I was astounded at the reception of so many people I met at the conference - some I met previously, and others I've never met before. I know it might be cheesey, but I'd like to call out some of these people and thank them, in no particular order, for various reasons...

* Firstly, [Jenny](https://twitter.com/miss_jwo). She is truly a pillar of the PHP community, and the PHPNW Conference team has sadly lost a valuable asset. She is always so busy making *everyone* feel welcome, and it really shows. Thank you so much for the lifts to and from the airport Jenny! And for everything that you do.
* [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/phpcodemonkey), for heading up the organisation of such a fantastic conference - a real asset to the UK's PHP community. Also, thank you to Jeremy and his father for some sagely words of advice and offering to help with advice and wisdom about a little thing we're planning.
* [Khayrattee (a.k.a. 7php)](https://twitter.com/7php) for coming to the conference and being so inspirational, and of course for being a great member of the community.
* [Anthony Ferrara](https://twitter.com/ircmaxell) and [Andrea Faulds](https://twitter.com/AndreaFaulds) for totally blowing my mind with some really insightful conversation on Saturday night.
* [Rowan Merewood](https://twitter.com/rowan_m) for being an elePHPant mule - finally I got to meet him after so long and thank him in person.
* [Igor Wiedler](https://twitter.com/igorwhiletrue) - another amazingly talented member of the PHP community. More mind blowing conversation.
* [Jordi Boggiano](https://twitter.com/seldaek), firstly for creating the awesome tool [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and secondly for being totally cool. We had an interesting discussion until late into the morning... Also, welcome to the UK Jordi.
* [Michelangelo van Dam](https://twitter.com/DragonBe) for the [PHP Benelux](http://www.phpbenelux.eu/) sticker!
* [Davey Shafik](https://twitter.com/dshafik) for everything you do for [PHP Women](http://phpwomen.org/), speaking remotely at [PHP Hampshire](http://www.phphants.co.uk) a while back, and just generally being awesome and a really nice chap!
* [Lorna Mitchell](https://twitter.com/lornajane) for help with Joind.in, for putting on a session to help conference speakers improve, in which I gained great insight.
* [Volker Dusch](https://twitter.com/__edorian) for the elePHPant swap (I'll get yours sent across right away buddy!) - and *wow* that keynote was absolutely fantastic!
* [Antonis](https://twitter.com/pavlakis) and [Clinton](https://twitter.com/cfing99) for putting on the Unconference
* Everyone who came to my [uncon talk](https://joind.in/12144) - and especially for the feedback (if you were there, please give me feedback if you haven't! I really want to get better at speaking, and that feedback is like gold dust to me! The same goes for all the speakers!)
* And finally, [Gary Hockin](https://twitter.com/geeh), [Paul Dragoonis](https://twitter.com/dr4goonis), [Rob Allen](https://twitter.com/akrabat), [Mike Maclean](https://twitter.com/mgdm), [Mark Baker](https://twitter.com/Mark_Baker), [Rick Ogden](https://twitter.com/rickogden), [Stuart Grimshaw](https://twitter.com/stubbs), [Petra](https://twitter.com/petradreis), [Mike](https://twitter.com/mvriel), [Skoop](https://twitter.com/skoop), [Rich](https://twitter.com/rich_81), [Kat](https://twitter.com/binarykitten), [Craig](https://twitter.com/craigwillis85), [Dave](https://twitter.com/fully_baked) and everyone in the [PHP Dorset](https://twitter.com/phpdorset) crew, [Chris](https://twitter.com/choult), [Michael](https://twitter.com/mheap) and so many more people that I've probably forgotten (sorry!), all for just being awesome and doing really great things in the community.

All in all, the conference was fantastic. Also thanks to all the organisers, the amazing speakers, the venue staff and everyone was even remotely involved in making the conference awesome - including all the friendly attendees I chatted with but have forgotten your names. See you next year, Manchester!

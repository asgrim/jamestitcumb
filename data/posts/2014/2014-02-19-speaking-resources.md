title: Resources for Public Speaking
---
Some of you who know me know that I'm trying to get more involved in speaking at conferences and user groups. Unfortunately it's a bit slow at the moment on account of our baby being due any day now (due date is in fact *tomorrow* - exciting!). However, I've put together a list of various resources to help me become a better speaker, and I thought I'd share it with the world.

I'm sincerely grateful to everyone who has given me advice, feedback and compliments in my journey so far, and it's this positive encouragement that is helping me want to keep improving myself. This is a bit of a new adventure for me, and I'm fascinated with where it might take me.

I've done just four public talks so far (you can see the feedback I received [here on Joind.in](https://joind.in/user/view/22381)) - three at user groups and one at the [PHPNW13 Uncon](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw13/unconference/) - which was a great experience on its own.

Rest assured, when the baby is all settled in, I'm going to start applying to speak at user groups across the UK, so if you attend user groups ([and you should!](http://www.dragonbe.com/2014/02/theres-no-php-user-group-here.html)) and I've been selected to speak, please do come along and let me know what you think - I'm interested in honest feedback!

title: Better Reflection 1.0.0 released
tags: [php, reflection]
---

Yay! The idea was [first committed](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/commit/ed0060ff) back on 3rd June 2015,
and after quite some time, work and effort, [Roave](https://roave.com/)'s Better Reflection has finally reached 1.0.0
release.

[Better Reflection](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection) is a library that mimics the core reflection API in PHP,
but adds many additional features and capabilities that are not possible in the core reflection API. Better Reflection
has lots of potential uses, and is already [*almost* compatible](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/blob/master/docs/compatibility.md)
with the core API.

You'll need at least PHP 5.6, but head over and see [what's changed](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/releases/tag/0.1.0).

**The future...**

The adventure doesn't end here! We've got loads of cool stuff planned, including:

 * [Monkey patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) !!
 * Further compatibility with core reflection
 * Ensuring full PHP 7 compatibility (e.g. with type declarations / return types etc.)
 * `getColumn()` function(s) to complement `getStartLine()` and `getEndLine()`
 * More cool stuff!

**Thank you...**

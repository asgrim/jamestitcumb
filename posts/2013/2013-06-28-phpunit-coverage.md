In our new projects at Netbasic / Ed, I am adamant that we will have 100% unit test coverage.

There's a distinction however that I've come to understand between having a fully comprehensive test suite, and _code coverage_. It's the _code coverage_ that I'm trying to reach 100%, not necessarily the test suite itself.

The reason for that is I think it's almost impossible have a fully comprehensive test suite (i.e. a test suite that tests every single possible scenario for a given unit), although we can have a pretty good stab at it.

However, I firmly believe that by having 100% _code coverage_ that it will drastically reduce the chance of problems happening. My reasoning for this is that if _all_ code within a module, component or application is "run" during the tests, then that **must** be a good thing.

Sorry for a pretty pathetic update after nearly seven months of no blog posts, but I'm a busy bee.

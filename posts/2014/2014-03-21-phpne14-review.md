title: PHPNE14 Review
---
Earlier this week was the PHPNE14 conference up in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which is run by the [PHPNE](http://phpne.org.uk/) user group. I had an absolutely fantastic time, and I even managed to talk at the uncon. I was staying at the [Sandman Signature](http://www.sandmansignature.co.uk/find-hotels/newcastle/) which was a really good quality hotel. Some of the modernisations weren't very practical, for example my shower managed to get almost the entire bathroom floor wet.

The evening before I was lucky enough to share dinner with conference speakers [Brandon Savage](https://twitter.com/brandonsavage), [Ross Tuck](https://twitter.com/rosstuck), [Rob Allen](https://twitter.com/akrabat) and [Jeroen van Dijk](https://twitter.com/jrvandijk) and some other ruffians [Richard](https://twitter.com/bagwaa) and [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexjakass). Afterwards there was a [GitHub social](https://github.com/blog/1785-newcastle-upon-tyne-drinkup) which was good to chat to even more new people. The free bar I think attracted many, and those who weren't there commented that they wish they'd known it was a free bar.

Anyway, here's how it went down. Up nice and early, I had breakfast at the hotel, and headed down to the lovely [Tyneside Cinema](https://www.tynesidecinema.co.uk/) venue. I was greeted with a bit of a queue for registration, I heard they had some technical hiccups, but during the wait I managed to be the [first to register](https://twitter.com/miss_jwo/status/445850185592504320) for the PHP Women Uncon. Not too much later was Ross Tuck's keynote "Things That I Believe Now I'm Old" which was insightful and a very clever talk. Afterwards, I watched a couple of Uncon talks, one by [Stefan](https://twitter.com/skoop) which I found personally useful as I'm trying to get more into speaking. Afterwards, I caught Jeroen's talk on Solr "Liking relevance!" which showcased lots of different functionality of Solr, so that's something I'm going to be looking into for future use cases (where appropriate, of course!).

After that was the break for lunch - the lunch was provided by the conference in the form of a black lunchbox, and it was crammed with food - sandwich, crisps, apple, chocolate and juice - plenty of food and it was good quality. A really great thing I heard was that all the leftover lunchboxes were donated to a local food bank - which I think was a terrific idea from the PHPNE team. During lunch I sat in the Digital Lounge and watched [Jenny's](https://twitter.com/miss_jwo) [PHP Women](http://www.phpwomen.org/) AMA session, in which she shared per personal story of trauma caused by bullying, her justification (if it were ever needed) of why an entity like PHP Women needs to exist.

A [PHP Hampshire](http://www.phphants.co.uk/) regular, [Phil Bennett](https://twitter.com/phil_bennett) was selected to speak at the conference, so naturally I went along to support his great talk with the best title "HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR DEVELOPMENT OF BEING A DEVELOPER WITHOUT DOING ANY DEVELOPMENT". A couple of slides appeared to go missing from his presentation, but apart from that and nerves showing a couple of times, he did really well, so nice one, Phil! It did run a little short, which meant I had good time to head down to the uncon and prepare for my talk at 3pm. I also had technical issues - my laptop kept crashing when I tried to "mirror" my display which was frustrating, and the crash managed to corrupt my presentation slides which took me out of the frame of mind. I know now to have as many backups as possible for future talks! Apart from that I think it went well, there were actually good questions at the end, so I guess that means I got some people thinking. It's also re-inforced my desire that I really do want to get more into speaking.

Philip Poots closing keynote was good, and surprised to find out it was his first time - he certainly showed no nerves. With a few final words afterwards and the prize draws, that drew the day to a close. Overall, it was great - the WiFi was a bit hit-or-miss, and the social afterwards was fun (but I think the music was a little loud and hampered conversations and socialising). I had some great conversations with the [Ingewikkeld](http://php.ingewikkeld.net/) team (and many more!) at the social, and of course I did partake in a game of [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) (which is typical when Stefan is around...). Many thanks to Anthony, the PHPNE14 team, the speakers, sponsors and the venue (with it's fantastically comfortable seats, I might add). Here's to next year!
